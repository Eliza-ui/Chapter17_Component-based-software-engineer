        <h3>CBSE Processes Overview</h3>
        <p>
          CBSE processes are software processes that support component-based software engineering.
          They take into account the possibilities of reuse and the different process activities involved
          in developing and using reusable componentss.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          Figure 17.6 (Kotonya, 2003) presents an overview of the processes in CBSE.
          At the highest level, there are two types of CBSE processes:
        </p>
        <ol start="1">
          <li><strong>Development for reuse</strong> — concerned with developing components or services that will be reused in other applications. It usually involves generalizing existing components.</li>
          <li><strong>Development with reuse</strong> — the process of developing new applications using existing components and services.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Process Objectives</h3>
        <p>
          These processes have different objectives and therefore include different activities.
          In the development for reuse process, the objective is to produce one or more reusable components.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          You know the components that you will be working with and you have access to their source code
          to generalize them. In development with reuse, you don’t know what components are available,
          so you need to discover these components and design your system to make the most effective use
          of them. You may not have access to the component source code.

        <h3>Component Acquisition</h3>
        <p>
          Component acquisition is the process of acquiring components for reuse or development into a reusable component.
          It may involve accessing locally developed components or services or finding these components from an external source.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p><strong>1️⃣ Component acquisition</strong> — ensures software engineers can identify, evaluate, and obtain reusable
          components either from within the organization or third-party vendors, making it easier to integrate them into new systems.</p>

        <h3>Component Management</h3>
        <p>
          Component management is concerned with managing a company’s reusable components,
          ensuring that they are properly cataloged, stored, and made available for reuse.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p><strong>2️⃣ Component management</strong> — maintains an organized repository of reusable components.
          It ensures they are documented, version-controlled, and accessible for developers to use in future projects.</p>

        <h3>CBSE for Reuse</h3>
        <p>
          CBSE for reuse is the process of developing reusable components and making them available
          for reuse through a component management system.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          The vision of early CBSE supporters was that a thriving component marketplace would develop,
          with specialist component providers and vendors organizing the sale of components.
          However, this vision has not been realized yet.

        <h3>Organizational Reuse</h3>
        <p>
          CBSE for reuse is most likely to take place within an organization committed to reuse-driven software engineering.
          They wish to exploit software assets from different parts of the company.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          However, internally developed components are not usually reusable without change.
          They often include application-specific features that limit reuse in other systems.

        <h3>Adapting Components</h3>
        <p>
          To make components reusable, you must adapt and extend them to create more generic versions.
          This adaptation has associated costs, so cost-effectiveness must be evaluated.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          You must decide if a component is likely to be reused and whether the savings justify the costs of making it reusable.
          Stable domain abstractions, like “accounts” or “patients,” are good reuse candidates.

        <h3>Improving Reusability</h3>
        <p>
          Changes made to improve reusability include removing application-specific methods,
          renaming functions, and adding more general functionality.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <ul>
          <li>Remove app-specific methods</li>
          <li>Change names for general use</li>
          <li>Add methods for full coverage</li>
          <li>Ensure consistent exception handling</li>
          <li>Add configuration interfaces</li>
          <li>Integrate and generalize interfaces</li>

        <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
        <p>
          Exception handling is a particularly difficult aspect.
          Components should not handle exceptions themselves, as each application has different requirements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="flip-card-back">
        <p>
          Instead, the component should define what exceptions can arise and publish these as part of the interface.
          For example, a stack component should detect and publish stack overflow and underflow exceptions.
        </p>
